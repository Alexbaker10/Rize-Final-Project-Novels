# American Novel Map

In this project I will create an interactive map that shows the settings of famous American Novels. As a lover of American novelists like John Steinbeck and Cormac McCarthy, I will create a tool to help bring the books we read to life.

* **Backend:** [Python/Flask]
* **Database:** [PostgreSQL]
* **Map Library:** [Leaflet.js, Mapbox]
* **Deployment:** **Docker**
